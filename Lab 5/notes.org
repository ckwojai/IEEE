* Tools
  - Pad, Trace, Polygon, Drill Hole, Silkscreen
  - ratsnest: reevaluate airwires for shortest path
  - ripup: delete routes
  - mirror: flip component to the other side
  - via: for connecting routes on different layers 
* Some rule of thumb
  - Trace: short and wide, increase spaces between traces
  - Trace width: 12 mm for digital signal; 20 mm for analog; Power, GND, Motor: 30mm;
  - 
* Layout Criteria
  - Everything need to be inside the board (all white frames inside): quadcopter propellers need clearance.
  - Nothing under white frame except the Radio Module
  - Battery JBT need to have +- on the edge of the PCB
  - Mandatory: Top Polygon: VCC, Bottom Polygon: GND; Don't worry about Digital and Analog VCC and GND.
