* Update <2017-10-27 Fri>
  *NOTE* We need to all be there for the checkpoints \\
  *Checked = Done; Unchecked = To be Done*
  - [X] Wiring of the radio module on both sides
  - [X] Schematics (Checkpoint 1)
  - [ ] Part B: I am almost done with the implementation of the library: RF24.cpp and nRF24L01.h
  - [ ] Part C: Writing code in Arduino for the Radio Module(s)
  - [ ] Part D: Writing code in Arduino for the game

* Update <2017-10-26 Thu>
  What weâ€™ve done today:
   - Headers Soldering on Arduino and Teensy
   - Wiring of the push button (resistor and capacitance RC constant) on the Arduino side
   - Wiring of the LED on the Teensy side
   - Wiring of the FTDI programmers to the Arduino
   - Editing the Library: implementation of write_register and read_register function in RF24.cpp
  What ARE to be done:
   - (Checkpoint 1)Draw full schematics for both receiver and transmitter
   - Wiring of power supply on both sides
   - Wiring of the radio module on both sides
   - Push button testing on the Arduino side
   - Implementation of other functions in RF24.cpp and nRF24L01.h
   - Part C: Communicating over the Radio Modules
   - Part D: Implementing Wireless Space Team
  *NOTE*: We need to go to Thomas for every checkpoints and he will ask questions to each of the team members, so be prepared guys~
