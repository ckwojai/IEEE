Updates on what weâ€™ve done today:
  - Headers Soldering on Arduino and Teensy
  - Wiring of the push button (resistor and capacitance RC constant) on the Arduino side
  - Wiring of the LED on the Teensy side
  - Wiring of the FTDI programmers to the Arduino
  - Editing the Library: implementation of write_register and read_register function in RF24.cpp
What ARE to be done:
  - (Checkpoint 1)Draw full schematics for both receiver and transmitter
  - Wiring of power supply on both sides
  - Wiring of the radio module on both sides
  - Push button testing on the Arduino side
  - Implementation of other functions in RF24.cpp and nRF24L01.h
  - Part C: Communicating over the Radio Modules
  - Part D: Implementing Wireless Space Team
*NOTE*: We need to go to Thomas for every checkpoints and he will ask questions to each of the team members, so be prepared guys~
